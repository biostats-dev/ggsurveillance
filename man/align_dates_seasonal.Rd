\title{Align dates for seasonal comparison}
\usage{
align_dates_seasonal(
  x,
  dates_from,
  date.resolution = "week",
  start = NULL,
  target_year = 2024
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame with a date column or a date vector}

\item{dates_from}{Column name containing the dates to align. Used when x is a data.frame.
supported date formats are date and datetime and also commonly used character strings:
\itemize{
\item ISO dates "2024-03-09"
\item Month "2024-03"
\item Week "2024-W09" or "2024-W09-1"
}}

\item{date.resolution}{Character string specifying the temporal resolution.
One of:
\itemize{
\item "week" or "isoweek" - Calendar weeks (ISO), reporting weeks according to the ECDC.
\item "epiweek" - Epidemiological weeks (CDC), i.e. ISO weeks with Sunday as week start.
\item "month" - Calendar months
\item "day" - Daily resolution
}}

\item{start}{Numeric value indicating epidemic season start:
\itemize{
\item For week/epiweek: week number (default: 28, approximately July)
\item For month: month number (default: 7 for July)
\item For day: day of year (default: 150, approximately June)
}}

\item{target_year}{Numeric value for the reference year to align dates to (default: 2024).}
}
\value{
A data frame with standardized date columns:
\itemize{
\item year: Calendar year from original date
\item week/month/day: Time unit based on chosen resolution
\item date_aligned: Date standardized to target year
\item season: Epidemic season identifier (e.g., "2023/24")
\item current_season: Logical flag for most recent season
}
}
\description{
Standardizes dates from multiple years to enable comparison of epidemic curves
and visualization of seasonal patterns in infectious disease surveillance data.
Commonly used for creating periodicity plots of respiratory diseases like
influenza, RSV, or COVID-19.
}
\details{
This function helps create standardized epidemic curves by aligning surveillance
data from different years. This enables:
\itemize{
\item Comparison of disease patterns across multiple seasons
\item Identification of typical seasonal trends
\item Detection of unusual disease activity
\item Assessment of current season against historical patterns
}

The alignment can be done at different temporal resolutions (daily, weekly,
monthly) with customizable season start points to match different disease
patterns or surveillance protocols.
